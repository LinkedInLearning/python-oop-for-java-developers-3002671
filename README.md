Most programmers are familiar with object-oriented programming (OOP), but do you know how it applies to Python? In this course, instructor Deepa Muralidhar trains Java developers in Python OOP. Deepa first introduces the key terms you will need to know. Then she walks you through class design, methods (including overloading), abstraction, inheritance, and more. Deepa goes in-depth on class design, with important details on Java syntax and Python syntax. Plus, she shows you Java syntax, Python syntax, abstract classes, and more with the correct inheritance text.
